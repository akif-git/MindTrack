# MindTrack
https://sthenic-smile.000webhostapp.com/

A 12-page interactive web application that gamifies mental health in a way that encourages users to keep track, evaluate, and seek help when needed. Specifically, we wanted to allow a user to keep track and evaluate their mental health by logging into the application and interacting with the wellness chatbot found on the userâ€™s dashboard. We also wanted to encourage the user to seek help through the resources page which contains various links to different mental health sites and services.

This project includes:
  -Implementation of data validation: 
      a)  Each page validates if the information is filled in properly and in a specific format (if needed). The login page and registration page review past data entries to             validate the login/registration information is accurate (active or not).
  -Responsive Design
      a) The website is fully compatible and 100% responsive with both smaller-screen devices such as smartphones and medium-screen devices such as tablets. 
  -Use of API
